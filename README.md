# AgeMod
A Minecraft 1.12.2 mod that adds player aging mechanics. (Based off of Years C mod by JinRyuu). 

# Overview
This mod introduces an aging system for players, starting from childhood and growing into adulthood over time.


# Development
Most of the source code was generated using AI.
I personally debugged and refined the mod to ensure functionality.
I had no prior experience with Minecraft modding but learned through the process.
